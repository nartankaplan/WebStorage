# WebStorage
A basic shopping web page with some DOM manipulations and local storage.

# Task
During my internship, I was given the task that should include followings below: 

Create a web application that allows users to add and remove items from a list and view the details of the items in the list.

Requirements:

Home Page:

Users should be able to add new items to the list.
Each item should include a title and a short description.
Users should have the option to delete any item from the list.
Detail Page:

When an item from the list is clicked, detailed information about that item should be displayed on another page or within a modal window.
The detail page or modal should include the itemâ€™s title, description, and an additional description section.
JavaScript Requirements:

Use DOM manipulation to perform the operations of adding, deleting, and viewing details of items in the list.
Implement these features using pure JavaScript, without any frameworks.
Make your code modular by using a component-based structure.
Bonus:

Use local storage to ensure that list items are not lost when the page is refreshed or closed.
Add a search function for the items, allowing users to search within the list.
